Who is the most likely user of this page?

The most likely user of this page is someone who wants to view their friend's photos, or the user who wants to upload and album.

What is that user's critical goal on that page?

View photos and create albums.

Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, the photos are prioritized over other content. The "Create Album" button could arguably be emphasized a bit more.

Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal?

Yes, photos are all grouped together with minimal gaps.

The options of creating an album, adding photos and adding video are grouped together.

What font families are most prominent on the page?

Same as before.

How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Same as before.

How do the line spacings, sizes and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The minimal spacing between photos works well to keep the focus on the photos themselves.

What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

I think they've done a good job, but as I said before, I would emphasize the "Create Album" button more.
