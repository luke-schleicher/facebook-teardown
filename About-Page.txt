Who is the most likely user of this page?

The most likely user of this page is someone who is looking at a friend's information or someone who is updating their own information.

What is that user's critical goal on that page?

The users' critical goals here are viewing information and updating information.

Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, section like "About", "Friends", "Photos" and "Videos" are clearly marked off. I think Facebook's got this page right.

In the "About" section, nav links to the left mark what information the user is viewing about this person.

Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal?

Yes. Sections are gathered in large white boxes, with simple gray marks delineating separate tasks and functions. There's a healthy amount of white space also separating separate types of information.

Nav bars are found either toward the top or left of a box, allowing the user to form expectations about how the navs and information will be arranged.

What font families are most prominent on the page?

San Francisco and the Mac System Fonts

How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

See previous descriptions--overall they contribute to the display of the page.

How do the line spacings, sizes and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

This page demonstrates more spacing between elements than other pages, which is refreshing.

What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

I wouldn't change much about this page.
